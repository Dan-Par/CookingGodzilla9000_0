		<h2 class="cursive">The Close to Perfect Steak</h2>
		<p>Many people gloat on the internet on how perfect their steak is and on how to cook them, but some of those methods may be the opposite of what professionals want;crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside, and you have got yourself a perfect steak. But of course, nothing as simple as salt, pepper, a bit of olive oil, and a store bought steak will do, and instead to get the perfect steak, we will need to resort to science and chemistry. First, a bit of thermodynamics, NEVER fry a frozen steak, even if it seems not icy. Heat tends to affect every inch of the outside of something to the inside, as well as cold, and it is the reason why some people's steak tend to burn on the outside while the inside is still lukewarm. So my take on it is to let a frozen steak warm up a bit in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours then let it rest in room temperature for at least one more hour. After that, I usually cut my steak in a cross hair fasion, often making cuts less than half a millimeter spaced out one way, then the same on the other way.Then comes to chemistry. The reason why some steaks are tough is because the proteins inside the meat denature into a more tough version than their uncooked versions when they were raw. To deal with that, add honey or pineapple juice. It contains protease, the enzyme key to breaking down proteins. Do not use too much pineapple juice because the savory flavor will be dampened. Season your steak using rock salt or sea salt, and lemon pepper. You can add pepper sparingly, but sdd a generous amount of salt, about one and a half tablespoon on each side evenly. Then comes the marinade. One thing to note: DO NOT oil your pan to fry a steak nor use butter. Reason being is that the marinade will be enough oil to cook the steak evenly. Get some EXTRA VRIGIN olive oil because that is the highest grade of olive oil you can find in most supermarkets and will taste amazing. Mix some garlic(both cloves or ground is fine) and whole Rosemary leaves, and then pour over the steaks. Flip the steaks and try to rub in as much marinade as possible. Then while you wait for the steak to soak the marinade in, you would want to cut up some onions and other vegetables to eat with the steak. My personal favourite are Portobello mushrooms and/or a bit of Korean squash. I julienne most of my vegetable cuts, but you are free to use any cutting technique. Then with the remaining time I preheat a pan(preferably non-stick) for about 5 minutes on medium heat. Then when it is time, turn the heat to high, and drop the steak ONLY, into the pan. It should make a very satisfying sizzling noise, and let it sear for 1 minute. Then flip the steak, and the color should be a dark brown, but not black or a light tan, and if that is the case, either the pan is too hot, too much honey/pineapple juice, or in the worst case scenario, your steak is boiling, meaning there is too much pineapple juice or somehow water of the amount of the oil you had in the marinade got in the pan. If it is the case of water, start over because you cannot fix denaturation unless you are working on a stove that can heat things up as hot as a heat shield in atmospheric re-entry, which is as hot as fusion reaction, which is of course, as hot as the surface of our star, the SUN. If all went well, turn the heat to a medium and wait for the steak to cook on the other side. One trick I use to measure how well done the steak is, is by using the finger trick. To get a sense of medium-rare, try making your thumb lightly touch your middle finger, then touch the lower left quarter of your palm. It closely approximates the spring of the cooked meat. For medium, instead of you middle finger, use your ring finger. Well done is your fifth finger, or pinky finger. Keep flipping it in one or two minute intervals, until the well-doneness is what is desired. Take the steak out on a plate. You are not done yet, for the vegetables still need to be cooked. In the pan you cooked the steak in, put in a cup of chardonnay red wine and soy sauce to deglaze it, and then add the remaining steak marinade and vegetables in. Cook time accordingly, for the steak could cool off by the time you are done. After that, plate the vegetables so that it sits NEXT to the steak, not on it. Add other side dishes to the plate and then you are done! Of course, this is MY VERSION of making a steak, for it may not be the best nor the worst way of making the steak, instead a way that I make it so that it tastes good to me, and it may not suit the tastes of everyone.

		<h3 class="cursive">How to Boil an Egg</h3>
		<p>I know this is shocking, but many people I have taken coking classes with and sometimes the teachers themselves do not know how to boil an egg. I know what you are saying, "Are you out of your mind? It is as easy as putting the egg in boiling water!" Almost, but not quite. You see a lot of the case, those eggs explode, leading to a less perfect egg. And from what I got from a poll, many people prefer a yolk that is still mostly runny, but yet many of the people I met had their eggs exploding or having their eggs not cooked to their/others desire. There is of course a plan of action into acheiving one of the best eggs you will ever make, and it is to let eggs be in a non-smelly environment. Though it is not alive, eggs tend to soak up surrounding smells, and it greatly affects their taste. Also, before you boil them, let them adjust to room temperature for about ten minutes, because like a steak, it can undercook in the inside and overcook on the outside. Then boil your water, and make sure to add a bit of salt to the water. It is sort of like how cells can be hypertonic or hypotonic. In a egg, there is a bit of salt, and the salt tries to get into equilibrium with the water, making the egg explode, like how blood cells can explode in a cup of water because of how much water is in the cell in comparison to the outside. When the water is boiling, gently put the egg in using a porous ladle. The cooking time for the perfect egg is around 5 minutes. You can try to guess the well-doneness of the egg by setting the max cooking time to ten minutes, and everything inbetween as sort of a gray-area. When cracking the egg, be delicate, even if it is time consuming. If you want to get straight to the yolk, note that there is a sharp and a more blunt end to the egg's shape. To get to the yolk immediately, a sure-fire way is to cut the blunt end off and enjoy! Remember that this is MY WAY and a few other people's way of boiling eggs.

		<p>Chop the onion in halves, and cut the onion making parallel cuts towards the root, but not cutting it. Then cut the other way, honing in on the root, and then when the root it the only thing left, throw away the root and you are done.</p>
