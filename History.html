		<p>
			As no one clearly knows what humans have done in the distant past in detail,
		we also do not know the ways of cooking that early humans have developed into what we have today.
		Archaeologists and anthropologists theorize that many instances of cooked meat
		in the pre-Neolithic times were by pure chance where humans ate the perished animals in a forest fire,
		before they discovered that fire was able to be made. When they did discover fire,
		they used fire for many things, but mainly to cook slain food. The first compound dish was a
		mix of grains and water which was dropped on a hot stone, which rose with time,
		that became a first form of bread.
			During the Neolithic time and the early times of the Mesopotamians, humans have discovered the ways of production of earthen pottery, which was made into many of the things that we use today, like pots and some types of pans. Many of the cooking techniques of today were also discovered, from frying, baking, boling stewing,etc, to the preservation of fod, like pickling and salting meats.
			From the Bronze Age metallurgy brought out the use of metal utensils, tools, and cooking methods. From that point on to today, many of the ingredients we use today were cultivated and domesticated, from cattle for meat, to wheat for flour, and to potatoes for not only food, but for gin.
